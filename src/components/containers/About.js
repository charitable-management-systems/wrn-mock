      <p>
        The retail automotive business offers exciting opportunities and challenges. 
        Once regarded as "a man's business," today some 1000 women in the US are successful 
        dealer owners / operators; and many more have found very satisfying careers as Executive 
        Managers / Directors and staff employees in sales, service and parts operations within dealerships.
        The Drive to Succeed Scholarship Program, sponsored by the GM Women's Retail Network, is intended to 
        increase opportunities for women in automotive retail.  We encourage all interested women to apply.
